# Recursion in Programming

1. **Base case**: Recursion requires a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursive function from calling itself. Without a base case, the recursion will continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

2. **Recursive case**: This is the part of the function where it calls itself with a modified input. This allows the problem to be broken down into smaller subproblems until the base case is reached.

3. **Memory usage**: Recursion can lead to increased memory usage, as each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. This can be a concern for large or deeply nested recursive functions.

4. **Performance**: In some cases, recursion may not be the most efficient solution to a problem, as it can incur overhead from repeated function calls. Iterative solutions may be more performant in certain scenarios.

5. **Readability**: Recursion can make code more readable and easier to understand, especially for problems that involve repetitive tasks or patterns. However, it can also make code harder to follow if not used judiciously.

6. **Function parameters**: Recursion often involves passing modified parameters to the recursive call, allowing the function to work on smaller instances of the original problem. This can lead to elegant and concise code.
